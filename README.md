## Mission

- I've never found any complete library to get all world countries, states, and cities. I want to develop the best one. Of course, contributors are welcome!!
- I took this [data](https://github.com/dr5hn/countries-states-cities-database) as a starting point.
- This package is a part of [countries-states-cities-service](https://github.com/Randagio13/countries-states-cities-service)

## Getting started

To get started with this library, you need to install it and add it to your project.

### Installation

Countries States Cities Service is available as an npm package.

```bash
# npm
npm install @ac-dev/countries-service

# yarn
yarn add @ac-dev/countries-service
```

### Import

Import single named import as follow:

```typescript
import { Countries } from '@ac-dev/countries-service'
```

## Usage

The code snippet below shows how to put into action `countries-service` in some common use cases.

- Get all countries.

```typescript
const countries = Countries.getCountries()
```

- Get all countries by `asc` sort.

```typescript

  sort: {
    mode: 'asc',
  },

```

- Get all countries by `desc` sort.

  sort: {
    mode: 'alphabetical',
    key: 'iso2',
  },

```

- Get all countries with localization.

```typescript
const countries = Countries.getCountries({ locale: 'it' })
```

- Get a country by iso2 code.

const countries = Countries.getCountries({ filters: { iso2: 'US' } })
```

  filters: { iso2: 'IT' },
  locale: 'it',
